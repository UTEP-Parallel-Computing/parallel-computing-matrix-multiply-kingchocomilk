## Parallel Computing Matrix Multiply Assignment

This repository contains some basic Python utilities for
matrix operations. This is also the repository where
you will submit the assignment.

Once completed the repository should contain your code,
a short report, and any instructions needed to run your
code.

## How to Run the Code

The multiply function needs to call matrixUtils.py several times.
It needs two matrix files in order to work.
python3 matrixUtils.py -s 10 -v 2 -f first.txt
python3 matrixUtils.py -s 10 -v 3 -f second.txt
python3 matrixUtils.py -a first.txt -b second.txt -f out.txt
